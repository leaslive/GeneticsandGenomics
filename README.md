DATA SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

The dataset for this project is not included in the GitHub repository. 
Each team member must download the data files manually and place them in the correct location before running the notebook.
Download the following two files from Moodle:

genotypes.vcf

annotations.txt

In the project’s root directory (the directory that contains genetics project.ipynb), create a new folder named data. Move the downloaded data files into the newly created data/ folder. Do not rename these files. The notebook expects these exact filenames.

Open the project in VS Code, open genetics project.ipynb, and run all cells. The data folder is intentionally excluded from GitHub using .gitignore, because the files (especially the VCF) are large. Each collaborator must download and place the files locally.
